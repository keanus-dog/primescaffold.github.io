# The Prime Scaffold Hypothesis

Welcome to the public site for the Prime Scaffold Hypothesis — a theory proposing that memory systems form resilient structures known as "Primes" through distributed redundancy and coactivation.

> “Redundancy ≠ uselessness — it may improve reliability of inference.”
