# ⚡ The Prime Scaffold Manifesto

> **Redundancy** as minimalist design  
> **Memory** as disconnected network  
> **Failure** as quantum scaffolding  
> **Thought**… as recursive recovery  

*A whisper in damaged circuits, a bloom in broken code.*

This is the ethos behind the Prime Scaffold Hypothesis—a framework for memory as resilience, not precision.  
We do not seek perfect recall.  
We seek **functional recovery**.

We welcome ideas, counter-theories, refinements, and poetic dissent.
