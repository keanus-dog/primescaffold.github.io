# The Prime Scaffold Hypothesis

## Lay Summary

Our brains don’t store memories like a filing cabinet. They’re more like intricate spiderwebs: any single memory can be accessed by many paths, and the more you use a path, the stronger it becomes.

Eventually, frequently traveled paths cluster into more efficient “supernodes” — backup structures that remain intact even if parts of the web are damaged. These "Primes" allow your brain to recall something even when a direct link is gone.

This hypothesis suggests that memory resilience isn’t just luck — it’s a biological design feature. And perhaps AI could benefit from it too.

## Formal Statement

After repeated co-activation of semantically related nodes (A–Z via N, O, Q, X), the brain forms a redundant memory cluster (“Prime”) enabling recall of A even when primary A–Z pathways are disrupted.

**Predicts:** Post-lesion recall from alternate nodes; faster re-learning of lost paths if Prime cluster existed pre-injury.
